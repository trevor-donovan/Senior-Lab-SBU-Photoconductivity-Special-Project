\section{Note}

    Photoconductivity is commonly analyzed in terms of the number and mobility of the excited electrons in an electron conduction band and of holes in a lower-energy valence band.\\
    We need to know the dark conductivity, band gap, light absorption spectrum, carrier mobility, quantum efficiency, response time, and impurities.


\section{properties}

    This part will show the basic properties of Indium Arsenide (InAs) which are related to photoconductivity.
    
    \subsection{basic parameters (no impurities)}
    
    Energy gap $0.354\,eV$ room temperature\\
    Intrinsic carrier concentration 	$1·1015\,\,cm^{-3}$\\
    Intrinsic resistivity 	$0.16\,\, \Omega\cdot cm$\\
    Effective conduction band density of states 	$8.7·1016\,cm^{-3}$\\
    Effective valence band density of states 	$6.6·1018\,cm^{-3}$\\
    Mobility of electrons 	$\leq4·104\,\, cm^2\cdot V^{-1}\cdot s^{-1}$\\

                    Solid and open symbols represent the results of p-i-n and p-n diodes,
                    respectively. The dashed lines denote the diffusion current while the dotted
                    line represents the generation-recombination current. The derived band gap
                    energy is 0.38 eV and the current ratio of two dashed lines is 3.3.}

    \subsection{response time}
    
        The device is based on the InAs/InAsSb type-II superlattice with highly doped p+/n+ tunneling junctions among the stages. The detector exhibits a response time of 9.87 ns under zero voltage condition, while for 0.15 V reverse bias, that time decreases to approximately 350 ps.

    \subsection{optical properties}
        Infrared refractive index	$\approx\, 3.51\,\,(300 K)$\\
        Radiative recombination coefficient	$1.1\times10^{-10}\,\, cm^3/s$\\
        Long-wave TO phonon energy $\approx\, 27\,\, meV\, (300 K)$\\
        Long-wave LO phonon energy $\approx\, 29\,\, meV\, (300 K)$
